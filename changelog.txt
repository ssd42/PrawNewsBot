Added emails.txt. Motive was that when sending a mass email users who where recieving the email could see all other emails who had recieved the same email. This way using a loop, each user will receive a unique email.
This is in order to setup for the idea of having each user receive personalized info.
Removed the while loop of the SMTP since it's now being run as a crontab and turned it into a function.
Added this changelog.
